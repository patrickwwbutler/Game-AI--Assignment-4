This framework needed some additional work.

First, there is no longer a MapStateManager. That module was recopied into two new ones: 
FieldMapManager and ForestMapManager.

Each of these is attached to its corresponding level.

Also, for each of the levels, I removed the binding of its Map Manager file from MainCamera since 
there was also a binding in that reserved GameObject PhaseManager. This was an unfortunate leftover
from an earlier framework.

I didn't attempt to update or remove those various messages from Little Red Riding Hood, etc. since 
you'll be changing those anyway.
